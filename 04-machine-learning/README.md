# Machine Learning

> Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Imagine teaching a child to recognize animals. You don't write down rules like "if it has 4 legs, fur, and barks, it's a dog." Instead, you show them many examples of dogs, and gradually their brain learns the pattern. That's essentially what machine learning is.

**Machine Learning = Teaching computers to learn from examples rather than following explicit instructions.**

Traditional programming: "Follow these exact steps."
Machine Learning: "Here are 1,000 examples. Figure out the pattern yourself."
